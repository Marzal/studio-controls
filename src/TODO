first task is to create a simple gui tool to administer user realtime privilege

 * list "real users" (UID between limits, and has a login shell)
 * toggle realtime privilege for each user (audio group and /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf)

Once changes have been made, check if current user has privileges by checking rlimits.
If not, ask to do fresh login for changes to have effect.
