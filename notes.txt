Ubuntustudio-controls version 1.11.3

New for this version
- Bug fixes: check if device removed signal is true
		Save last valid internal device so removing USB device
		allows controls to switch to something sane.
- moved config file to it's own directory so that we can add
		more files like post start scripts.
- Converted config file to use configparser for less accident prone
		maintenance.
- Declutter audio setup GUI by splitting it into three tabs
