=================

At present, controls should be tested for:
	- defaults are correct (no config file)
		both in running instance (autojack autostarts)
			- check pavucontrol shows devices and sends sound through
		and in GUI
      - not in performance
      - boost (if available) is on
      Audio should show correct defaults
	- config file in ~/.config/autojackrc is read and used.
		in running instance
		In GUI
		when gui saves this file should vanish
	- config file in ~/.config/autojack/autojackrc
		in running instance
      start jack
      change everything make sure whats actually runnig echoes config
		in GUI
      Gui should show last config change
