Installing Studio Controls
==========================

in a terminal enter:

sudo make install

The standard install is into /usr/local/*
Packagers can make use of the ‘PREFIX’ and ‘DESTDIR’ variable during install, like this: 
$ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=./test-dir

To remove:

sudo make uninstall

Note: if PREFIX= or DESTDIR= were used for install then they must be used
		for uninstall as well


Please Note: Studio Controls is not meant to run on the same machine as
	other session based jack controllers like Cadence. In fact, if
	Cadence has ever been run on the same partition it is possible that
	studio-controls will not work properly even if Cadence has been
	removed later because Cadence leaves extra config files around
	that interfere with the operation of studio-controls. Packagers
	should mark Cadence as something that conflicts with studio-controls.

This software should not be packaged as a flatpack, snap or other sandbox
style package. These packaging schemes do not work well with jack aware
applications or audio applications that use audio plugins.
