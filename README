UbuntuStudio Controls

This is a small application to allow setting up audio for (semi)pro
audio work.

The application first checks to see if application will have access to
memory locking and real time priorities. If not, a warning is displayed
and a checkbox allows repairing this. After repairing this the user needs
to log out and back in for the new setting to have effect, there is
a warning to this effect.

It is assumed that jack will run at session start and not be stopped till
session end. However, it is possible to override this.

Everything is working (if not optimally) except that USB audio device
hot plug detection has not yet been implemented.
