 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Bugs:
	Fixed - Backends All use different commands to do the same things
	fixed - zita needs to read in all rates

Features:
	- logrotate for shorter log files
	- jack client should start once and detect jack stop callback
		check DSP regularly and add xruns.
	- jack detection when jack is stopped should only happen once
		when entering audio settings page.
	- add pre/post jack start/stop scripting
	- add usb bridge and pulse bridge tabs
		- USB bridge tab should have a way to set devices
			not to bridge.
		- pulse bridge should allow for naming bridges
	- add drawing tablet support
		- start with setting size and setting buttons
	- add the rest of the supported backends
	- add button to system page to select between lowlatency or generic
		kernel as default.
	- monitor headphone plug status if PCH is being used for output
		switch to headphones or speakers in alsa. use alsa level/mute
		controls but add hook for user script. This will involve
		moving autojackrc into .config/autojack/ so new V3 for ping.
		So two commits.
	- add use of internals (net manager, audio and net adapters)
		option to use audioadapter instead of zita bridge?
		that may only work for one device, zita can do many.
	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
	- pulse profiles for multi-channels devices. (including jack)
		This is really pulse related not -controls
