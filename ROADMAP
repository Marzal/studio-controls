 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Need to change autojack to accept start/restart/stop parameter
	- should restart be different from start?

Need to do all of USB hot plug detection
	- write udev rules
	- write connect script
	- change RC file to start correctly with usb device plugged or not
