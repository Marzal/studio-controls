 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Need to detect cadence and not mess with it.

Need to change autojack to accept start/restart/stop parameter
	- autojack is now dbus opperated and runs for whole session
	- should restart be different from start? NO
		- can check for running jack and internally choose
	- should check if DEV exists, use "default" otherwise
	- need to rewrite rcfile on USB plugin to include usb device(s)
		No I don't need to. I only need one USB device, the one the user
		wants to be jack master if it happens to be plugged in. All
		others are bridged or not.

Need to not remove a device from XDEV just because it does not exist?
maybe same for DEV? (change device name to card,dev,sub (unplugged))

Need to do all of USB hot plug detection
	- write udev rules - Done
	- write connect script - Done
	- change RC file to start correctly with usb device plugged or not
		Actually this would be in Autojack
	- hw:USB,0 is the only device to become jack master hw:USB,1 etc.
		will be clients. Not true... but I don't have any to test this with

Bugs:
FIXED	- only one USB device can be detected.
Fixed	- udev sometimes redetects already known devices and connects them
	- Apply audio configuration change restarts jack instead of changing
		things that have changed, most things can be changed with jack
		running. Connections to audio interfaces could easily be saved and
		reconnected as well.
	- dbus service file missing / not working
	- Default Output Device - should only list devices jack can see:
		jack master or "Remove list" and have outputs
Features:
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
	- monitor headphone plug statis if PCH is being used for output
		switch to headphones or speakers in alsa.
