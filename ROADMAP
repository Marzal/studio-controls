 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Bugs:
	- dbus service file missing / not working
	FIXed - USB is only device, doesn't work right
	- add device mixer button
	Fixed - startup should detect if jack running and set internal value True

	--------------------------8<---------------------
	/usr/bin/ubuntustudio-controls:15: DeprecationWarning: Importing dbus.glib
	to use the GLib main loop with dbus-python is deprecated. Instead, use this sequence:

    from dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop

    DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)

	import dbus.glib
	-------------------------8<------------------------

Features:
	Done(ish)- needs backend ALSA/FireWire/Dummy
		Note: BE != alsa should disable some things:
			USB master disable but USB can still be bridged
			Jack master needs to be cleared and be text entry
			Firewire back end should check for availablity of FW
	Done - remove auto start jack check box
	Done - add Jack running indicator
	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
	- monitor headphone plug status if PCH is being used for output
		switch to headphones or speakers in alsa.
	- pulse bridge setup for more than one bridge
	- pulse profiles for multi-channels devices. (including jack)
	- deal with two identical USB decies
