 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Fixes:
	- none known

Features:
	- redo extra devices to see one device at a time.
		- Each device should have:
			- Sample rate
			- buffer size
			- nperiods
			- channel count, in and out
			- on, off, hide
		- The device list should include devices detected only once. That
			is, the device should be configurable even if unplugged/unpowered.
		- There must be sane defaults for unknown devices in autojack
		- In autojack, some of this info could be added to the device db
	- add pre/post jack start/stop scripting
	- Add jackmixer  or jack-mix-box? auto start and connect
	- Add packagers file describing depends/conflicts
	- Add mutiple devices for firewire
	- bluetooth via pulse. use: pacmd load-module module-loopback latency_msec=5
		and: pacmd unload-module module-loopback
		need to figue out how to auto route jack->pulse bridge to loop
		and loop to bt device.
	- add drawing tablet support
		- start listing xsetwacom and xsetpointer devices and allowing
		user to take pointers and add them to wacom devices (if possiblle)
		- add module that allows setting of display settings in tablets that
		have displays.
		- Then see if we can match plasma utility for setting size and 
		setting buttons etc.
	- USB devices should not have a buffer size 16, PCH should be 64 and
		above. USB devices at 32 should probably set periods to 3.

	- add button to system page to select between lowlatency or generic
		kernel as default.
	- add use of internals (net manager, audio and net adapters)
		option to use audioadapter instead of zita bridge?
		that may only work for one device, zita can do many.
	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
