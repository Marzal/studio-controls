 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Bugs:
	- dbus service file missing / not working

Features:
	- Need periods (currently uses 2 but sometimes 3 is better)
	- needs backend ALSA/FireWire/Dummy
	- remove auto start jack check box
	- add Jack running indicator
	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
	- monitor headphone plug status if PCH is being used for output
		switch to headphones or speakers in alsa.
