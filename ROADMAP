 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Need to change autojack to accept start/restart/stop parameter
	- autojack is now dbus opperated and runs for whole session
	- should restart be different from start?
		- can check for running jack and internally choose
	- should check if DEV exists, use "default" otherwise
	- need to rewrite rcfile on USB plugin to include usb device(s)

Need to not remove a device from XDEV just because it does not exist?
maybe same for DEV? (change device name to card,dev,sub (unplugged))

Need to do all of USB hot plug detection
	- write udev rules - Done
	- write connect script - Done
	- change RC file to start correctly with usb device plugged or not
		Actually this would be in Autojack
	- hw:USB,0 is the only device to become jack master hw:USB,1 etc.
		will be clients.
	- may be best to move most of autojack in here... maybe make this
		autojack. autostart/autojack.desktop can start it at asession
		start and -controls can send dbus messages to control it:
		start, stop, restart, reconfig

Bugs:
	- only one USB device can be detected.
	- udev sometimes redetects already known devices and connects them
	- Apply audio configuration change restarts jack instead of changing
		things that have changed, most things can be changed with jack
		running. Connections to audio interfaces could easily be saved and
		reconnected as well.
	- dbus service file missing / not working
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
