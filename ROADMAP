 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Bugs:
	- Backends All use different commands to do the same things
		- add the rest of the supported backends

Features:
	- allow to choose no of i/o with dummy (all) backend
	- Allow USB bridging to be inputs only
		for badly designed input devices with hanging
		outputs.
	- monitor headphone plug status if PCH is being used for output
		switch to headphones or speakers in alsa. use alsa level/mute
		controls but add hook for user script. This will involve
		moving autojackrc into .config/autojack/ so new V3 for ping.
		So two commits.
	- needs backend ALSA/FireWire/Dummy
		Note: BE != alsa should disable some things:
			USB master disable but USB can still be bridged
			Jack master needs to be cleared and be text entry
			Firewire back end should check for availablity of FW
	- add use of internals (net manager, audio and net adapters)
		option to use audioadapter instead of zita bridge?
		that may only work for one device, zita can do many.
	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
	- pulse profiles for multi-channels devices. (including jack)
		This is really pulse related not -controls
